# Web-Scraping
A project to extract data from a website.

The  website www.autolist.com lists all the available cars in the market. In this project I have extracted details of Tesla car models. I have extracted 100 records from 5 webpages. I have used the website's API to access the data and finally stored it in an excel file.
